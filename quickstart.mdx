## What is Simplified Webhooks?

Tired of waiting for your Make scenarios to notice changes in Airtable? Simplified Webhooks replaces slow, polling-based triggers with instant webhooks. This means your automations run in **seconds, not minutes**, after a record is created, updated, or deleted.

Our Make app handles all the complexity for you. You simply connect your accounts and we set up the instant connection to Airtable automatically.
