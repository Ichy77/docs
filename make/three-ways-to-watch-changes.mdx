# 3 Ways to Watch Airtable Changes with Make

> Want to trigger your Make scenarios exactly when something changes in Airtable? Let's explore three powerful approaches to help you choose the perfect solution for your automation needs.

Connecting Airtable to Make opens up powerful automation possibilities. But triggering your Make scenario at _exactly_ the right moment can be tricky. Here are three battle-tested approaches, each with its own strengths and limitations.

## 1. Airtable Automation \+ Scripting Action

This native approach uses Airtable's built-in automation features. You set up an automation that triggers based on your desired conditions (e.g., record created, updated, or matches specific criteria). The automation includes a 'Run script' action that makes an API call to a generic 'Webhook' module in your Make scenario.

**Pros:**

- No additional tools needed (uses Airtable's native features)
- Fine-grained control over trigger conditions
- Direct integration within Airtable

**Cons:**

- Requires JavaScript knowledge for the script step
- Needs a **paid Airtable plan** for script actions
- Performance issues with large databases
- No built-in way to detect deleted records
- Additional place for automations

```javascript
const inputConfig = input.config();
const data = {
   record_id: inputConfig.recordID,
   source:'...' //provide information like the automation's name or URL
};

const options = {
   method: 'POST',
   body: JSON.stringify(data),
   headers: {
      'Content-Type':'application/json'
   }
}

let response = await fetch('{webhookUrl}', options);
```

If you want to use Airtable automations, you can use this script. Simply insert the webhook URL you receive from Make into the variable `webhookUrl`**.**

## 2. Make's 'Watch Records' Module (Polling)

The traditional approach shown in most Make tutorials. Add an Airtable`Watch Records`trigger to your scenario, and Make will periodically check your base for changes.

**Pros:**

- Simple setup process
- No coding required
- Built into Make's core features

**Cons:**

- Heavy on operations (checking frequently adds up)
- Can miss rapid changes between checks
- Delayed triggers (not real-time)
- No deleted record detection
- Higher costs on paid Make plans
- Needs specific columns to work at all

## 3. Simplified Webhooks

A modern approach using our dedicated webhook service. Connect your Airtable base to Simplified Webhooks and use our purpose-built Make modules for instant notifications.

**Pros:**

- True real-time triggers
- Zero coding required
- Extremely efficient on Make operations
- Dedicated modules for created, updated, AND deleted records
- Generous free tier available

**Cons:**

- Requires an additional service setup (but it's worth it\!)

## Making Your Choice

Here's a quick decision guide:

| Feature           | Airtable Automation | Make's Watch Records | Simplified Webhooks |
| ----------------- | :-----------------: | :------------------: | :-----------------: |
| Setup Difficulty  | Medium              | Easy                 | Easy                |
| Coding Required   | Yes                 | No                   | No                  |
| Real-time Updates | Yes                 | No                   | Yes                 |
| Delete Detection  | No                  | No                   | Yes                 |
| Cost Efficiency   | Medium              | Low                  | High                |
| Free Tier         | No                  | Yes\*                | Yes                 |

> \*Make's free tier has limited operations, which can be quickly consumed by frequent polling

## Conclusion

While each method has its place, **Simplified Webhooks** stands out as the most robust solution for NoCode users who need reliable, real-time Airtable triggers. It combines the best of both worlds: the simplicity of Make's Watch Records with the immediacy of Airtable Automations, plus adds crucial features like delete detection.

Choose based on your needs:

- ðŸ”§ **Airtable Automation:** When you are already on a paid Airtable plan and don't need advanced information such as who changed what.
- ðŸ•’ **Make's Watch Records:** For simple, low-frequency updates
- âš¡ **Simplified Webhooks:** For real-time, efficient, and complete change detection

> **Pro Tip:** Start with Simplified Webhooks' free tier to experience the benefits of real-time webhooks without any commitment. You can always adjust your approach as your needs evolve.
