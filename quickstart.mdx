## What is Simplified Webhooks?

Tired of waiting for your Make.com scenarios to notice changes in Airtable? Simplified Webhooks replaces slow, polling-based triggers with instant webhooks. This means your automations run in **seconds, not minutes**, after a record is created, updated, or deleted.

Our Make.com module handles all the complexity for you. **There are no webhook URLs to copy and paste.** You simply connect your accounts and our module sets up the instant connection to Airtable automatically.

## Getting Started Guide

<Steps>
  ### Step 1: Set up your Simplified Webhooks Account

  First, you'll need a Simplified Webhooks account, and to connect it to Airtable.

  1. **Sign up for a free account.**

       </Card>
     </CardGroup>

  <br />

  2. **Connect your Airtable account.**
     You'll need to create a Personal Access Token in Airtable to allow Simplified Webhooks to monitor your bases.

         You can create a Personal Access Token in your Airtable account settings. For detailed instructions, refer to the official Airtable documentation.

         <div style={{ position:"relative",paddingBottom:"56.25%",height:0,overflow:"hidden",maxWidth:"100%" }}>

         </div>
       </Accordion>
     </AccordionGroup>

  <br />

  3. **Create a Simplified Webhooks API Key.**
     This key is used to connect your Make.com account to Simplified Webhooks. You can create an API key in your profile settings.

     <Note>
       **Important:** Treat your API key like a password. Store it in a safe place and do not share it.

     </CardGroup>

  ### Step 2: Configure the Module in Make.com

  Now, head over to your Make.com account to add and configure the module.

  1. In your Make scenario, add a new module and search for **Simplified Webhooks**.
  2. Select the trigger you need (e.g., `Watch New Records`, `Watch Updated Records`).
  3. Make will prompt you to create a new connection. Give it a name, and paste in the **API Key** you created in the previous step.
  4. Once the connection is active, simply select the Airtable **Base** and **Table** you want to watch from the dropdown menus.

  Here is a short video that shows you how to configure the module in Make:

  {/* Replace with your YouTube embed code */}

  <div style={{ position:"relative",paddingBottom:"56.25%",height:0,overflow:"hidden",maxWidth:"100%" }}>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOUR_SECOND_VIDEO_ID" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowFullScreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%" }} />

  </div>

  ### Step 3: You're done\!

  That's it\! Your Make.com scenario will now run instantly whenever a record is changed in your selected Airtable base.
