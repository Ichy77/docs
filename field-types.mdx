title: "How we process different field types."
description: "You can store different types of data within Airtable. From simple text to files to referencing one or multiple collaborators. This information is stored in different formats within Airtable."

## We simplified the different field types into an easily consumable structure.

While webhooks for _New Airtable Records_ will only every contain the `current` values of a column. The webhooks for _Updated Airtable Records_ will contain the `current` and the `previous` values of a column.

Let's start with the basics and end with the more advanced columns later.

### String Columns

All of our webhooks will deliver columns of the type:\
`Email`\
`Long Text`\
`Phone` \
`Rich Text` \
`URL` and \
`Single Line Text`  

as **simple strings**.

```json
"fld...": {										//column Id
	"name": "Test Column", 						//column Name
	"current": "https://www.drinkforfood.de" 	//current column Value
}
```

### Date Columns

All of our webhooks will deliver columns of the type:\
`Date`\
`Last Modified Time`\
`Created Time`

as **ISO-8601 formatted dates**.

```json
"fld...": {										//column Id
	"name": "Test Date Column", 				//column Name
	"current": "2025-07-19T09:08:39.000Z" 		//current column Value
}
```

### Number Columns

All of our webhooks will deliver columns of the type:\
`Number`\
`Duration`\
`Percent`\
`Count`\
`Auto Number`\
`Rating`\
`Currency`

as **numbers**.

```json
"fld...": {										//column Id
	"name": "Test Number Column", 				//column Name
	"current": 3.4, 							//current column Value
}
```

### Boolean Columns

Boolean values can be returned by multiple column types but formulas, rollups or lookup columns have varying output formats. `Checkbox columns`, however, will always be delivered as booleans if the column is `true`.

<Info>
  If checkbox columns are `false`, Airtable does not send this information. That's why empty values for a checkbox column have to be treated as `false`.
</Info>

```json
"fld...": {										//column Id
	"name": "Test Checkbox Column", 			//column Name
	"current": true, 							//current column Value
}
```

### Single Collaborator Columns

Columns that only contain a single user such as `Last Modified By`, `Created By` or `Single User` columns will be sent with a **single user object**:

```json
"fld...": {										//column Id
	"name": "Test Created By Column", 			//column Name
	"current": {
		"email":"test.user@gmail.com",			//user Email
		"id":"usrnwwJUfsBR6EMXl",				//user Id
		"name":"Test User"						//user Name
	}				
}
```

### Multiple Select Columns

Now we start to go into more complex column types.

**Multiple Select columns** will be delivered as flat arrays containing the names of the selected options.

```json
"fld...": {										//column Id
	"name": "Test Multiple Select Column", 		//column Name
	"current": [								//current column Value
		"Option1",
		"Option2"
	] 							
}
```

### Linked Record Columns

**Linked Record fields** will also be delivered as flat arrays but they will contain the record Ids of the linked records. 

```json
"fld...": {										//column Id
	"name": "Test Linked Record Column", 		//column Name
	"current": [								//current column Value
		"recRPq7LWatCDsBXm",
		"recsyxrrqFUZ4OWEN"
	] 							
}
```

### **Multiple Collaborators Columns**

User columns in Airtable can either select one user (which we covered [here](https://docs.simplified-webhooks.com/field-types#single-collaborator-columns)) or multiple users. For columns with **Multiple Collaborators** the format will be:

```json
"fld...": {											//column Id
	"name": "Test Mulitple Collaborator Column", 	//column Name
	"current": [									//current column Value
		{
			"email": "test.user@gmail.com",			//user E-Mail
			"id": "usrnwwJUfsBR6EMXl",				//user Id
			"name": "Test User 1"					//user Name
		},
		{
			"email": "test.user2@gmail.com",		//user E-Mail
			"id": "usrnwwJUfsBR6EMXl",				//user Id
			"name": "Test User 2"					//user Name
		}
	] 							
}
```

### Attachment Columns

Columns containing attachments will be sent as follows: 

```json
"fld...": {										//column Id
	"name": "Test Attachment Column", 			//column Name
	"current": [								//current column Value
		{
			"id": "...",				//attachment Id
			"url": "...",				//file URL (only valid for 2h)
			"size":,					//file Size
			"type":"",					//file Type
			"filename":""				//file Name
		},
		{
			"id": "...",				//attachment Id
			"url": "...",			//file URL (only valid for 2h)
			"size":,				//file Size
			"type":"",				//file Type
			"filename":""			//file Name
		}
	] 							
}
```

### AI Text Columns

For the newest of the columns the **AI Text** columns we are able to not only send the value but also the `state` and if it's `stale` (for definitions see [here](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/field-model#aitext)). These additional values might be important to you if you want to know if you can use the value or if you should wait and for an updated value in the AI Text columns.

Based on that, the format for `AI Text columns` will be:

```json
"fld...": {										//column Id
	"name": "Test AI Text Column", 				//column Name
	"current": {
		"state": "loading",						//column State
		"value": "Test Value",					//column Value
		"isStale": false,						//should be recomputed?
	}					
}
```
