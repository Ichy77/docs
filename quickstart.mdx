This guide will walk you through setting up Simplified Webhooks to monitor your Airtable bases.

## 1. Sign Up

First, you'll need a Simplified Webhooks account.

## 2. Connect Airtable

Next, connect your Airtable account by creating a Personal Access Token.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="How to get your Airtable Personal Access Token">
        <p>
            You can create a Personal Access Token in your Airtable account settings. For detailed instructions, refer to the official Airtable documentation.

        </p>
        <p>
            We've also prepared a short video to walk you through the process:
        </p>
        {/* Replace with your YouTube embed code */}
        <div style={{
            position: 'relative',
            paddingBottom: '56.25%',
            height: 0,
            overflow: 'hidden',
            maxWidth: '100%',
        }}>
            <iframe
                src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOUR_VIDEO_ID"
                frameBorder="0"
                allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                allowFullScreen
                style={{
                    position: 'absolute',
                    top: 0,
                    left: 0,
                    width: '100%',
                    height: '100%',
                }}
            ></iframe>
        </div>
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 3. Create an API Key

Now, you'll need an API key from Simplified Webhooks to use in your Make app.

You can create an API key in your profile settings, right below the Airtable connection section.

<Note>
  **Important:** Treat your API key like a password. Store it in a safe place and do not share it.
</Note>

## 4. Set up your Make module

Log into your Make.com account and set up the Simplified Webhooks module using the API key you just created.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="How to set up the Make module">
        <p>
            Here is a short video that shows you how to configure the module in Make:
        </p>
        {/* Replace with your YouTube embed code */}
        <div style={{
            position: 'relative',
            paddingBottom: '56.25%',
            height: 0,
            overflow: 'hidden',
            maxWidth: '100%',
        }}>
            <iframe
                src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOUR_SECOND_VIDEO_ID"
                frameBorder="0"
                allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                allowFullScreen
                style={{
                    position: 'absolute',
                    top: 0,
                    left: 0,
                    width: '100%',
                    height: '100%',
                }}
            ></iframe>
        </div>
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 5. You're done!

That's it! You can now watch for new, updated, and deleted records in your Airtable base directly from Make.
