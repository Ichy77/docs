title: "How we process different field types."
description: "You can store different types of data within Airtable. From simple text to files to referencing one or multiple collaborators. This information is stored in different formats within Airtable."

## We simplified the different field types into an easily consumable structure.

While webhooks for _New Airtable Records_ will only every contain the `current` values of a column. The webhooks for _Updated Airtable Records_ will contain the `current` and the `previous` values of a column.

Let's start with the basics and end with the more advanced columns later.

### String Columns

All of our webhooks will deliver columns of the type:\
`Email`\
`Long Text`\
`Phone` \
`Rich Text` \
`URL`and \
`Single Line Text`  

as **simple strings**.

```json
"fld...": {										//column Id
	"name": "Test Column", 						//column Name
	"current": "https://www.drinkforfood.de" 	//current column Value
}
```

### Date Columns

All of our webhooks will deliver columns of the type:\
`Date`\
`Last Modified Time`\
`Created Time`

as **ISO-8601 formatted dates**.

```json
"fld...": {										//column Id
	"name": "Test Date Column", 				//column Name
	"current": "2025-07-19T09:08:39.000Z" 		//current column Value
}
```

### Number Columns

All of our webhooks will deliver columns of the type:\
`Number`\
`Duration`\
`Percent`\
`Count`\
`Auto Number`\
`Rating`\
`Currency`

as **numbers**.

```json
"fld...": {										//column Id
	"name": "Test Number Column", 				//column Name
	"current": 3.4, 							//current column Value
}
```

### Boolean Columns

Boolean values can be returned by multiple column types but formulas, rollups or lookup columns have varying output formats. `Checkbox columns`, however, will always be delivered as booleans if the column is `true`.

<Info>
  If checkbox columns are `false`, Airtable does not send this information. That's why empty values for a checkbox column have to be treated as `false`.
</Info>

```json
"fld...": {										//column Id
	"name": "Test Checkbox Column", 			//column Name
	"current": true, 							//current column Value
}
```

### Flat Arrays

Now we start to go into more complex column types.

**Multiple Select columns** will be delivered as flat arrays containing the names of the selected options.

```json
"fld...": {										//column Id
	"name": "Test Multiple Select Column", 		//column Name
	"current": [								//current column Value
		"Option1",
		"Option2"
	] 							
}
```

**Linked Record fields** will also be delivered as flat arrays but they will contain the record Ids of the linked records. 

```json
"fld...": {										//column Id
	"name": "Test Linked Record Column", 		//column Name
	"current": [								//current column Value
		"recRPq7LWatCDsBXm",
		"recsyxrrqFUZ4OWEN"
	] 							
}
```

### Complex Arrays

User columns in Airtable can either select one user (which we covered here) or multiple users.
